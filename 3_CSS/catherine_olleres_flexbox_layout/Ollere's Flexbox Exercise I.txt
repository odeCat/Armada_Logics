Ollere's Flexbox Exercise I

The flexbox exercise took me over an hour to make. I had to refine and adjust the code according to the image reference.

I had experimented with the flexbox gap in the main container, I also used the margin-bottom quite a lot. One thing for this specific exercise is that flexbox works best if I consider how the items expand or shrink.
